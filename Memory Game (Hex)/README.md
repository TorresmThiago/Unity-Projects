# Memory Game
### About: 
#### "The memory game is a classic game formed by pieces that present a figure in two pieces. Each figure is repeated in two pieces. On your turn, turn over two pieces and let everyone see it. If the figures are the same, the participant must return to himself and play again. The turn passed to the next participant. Whoever has the most pairs at the end of the game wins the game." - Wikipedia
