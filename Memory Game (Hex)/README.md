# Memory Game
### About: 
#### "The memory game is a classic game formed by pieces that present a figure in two pieces. Each figure is repeated in two pieces. On your turn, turn over two pieces and let everyone see it. If the figures are the same, the participant must return to himself and play again. The turn passed to the next participant. Whoever has the most pairs at the end of the game wins the game." - Wikipedia

### MVP developed: 
#### 07/07/22 ~ 11/07/22

### Refined version developed:

### Studied Concepts: 

* Use of the animator component in order to set triggers (Animation lifecycle, transitions, etc)
* UI button to easily detect player click (used in combination with the animator)
* UI Canvas properties, such as pivot, borders, RectTransform
* '''List''' and '''string''' Properties to handle the randomness of cards  
* UI Layout Groups to hold cards on diferent screen sizes
* Unity Ad Service


### On-Going TODO List:  

* Menu, with settings and instructions (players may not know what RGB color system is)
* Options to watch an ad so that I can get a few cents? maybe
* Background Animations
* Dificulty system ("implemented", need more colorsss)
* Maybe think of a point system... Time, moves?
* Need sound effects!
