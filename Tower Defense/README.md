# Tower Defense
### About: 
#### "Tower defense (TD) is a subgenre of strategy games where the goal is to defend a player's territories or possessions by obstructing the enemy attackers or by stopping enemies from reaching the exits, usually achieved by placing defensive structures on or along their path of attack. This typically means building a variety of different structures that serve to automatically block, impede, attack or destroy enemies. Tower defense is seen as a subgenre of real-time strategy video games, due to its real-time origins, even though many modern tower defense games include aspects of turn-based strategy. Strategic choice and positioning of defensive elements is an essential strategy of the genre." - Wikipedia

### Studied Concepts: 

* Use of a spritesheet instead of multiple sprites
* Use of the Animation Component to play a single Animation clip
* Using Tilemap to create a grid so that the level could be drawn
* ~~Learned about pathfinding to make enemys proceed to end of level~~ Updated to pre-scripted path on each enemy
* With collision triggers, creation of a list of enemys on range so that tower focus could be aplied
* Rotation scripts so that missiles face the direction they're facing
* ~~Custom UI design with animators~~ Decided not to use the Unity UI with spriterenderer elements 
* Using unity events, created a script that mimics the behaviour of the Unity UI Button 


### Possible TODO features:  

* Fix bugs hihihihi
* Instructions
* Gameflow with gameover and score
* Tower upgrades
* In-game currency 
* Menu with local scores
* Sound options
* Animations on shoots and enemy destruction
